## Features of Task I couldn't finish (To Do?)

- Custom Percentage Button
- Mobile Design
- Correct Resizement of Elements when resizing window
- Hover states of Buttons

## Coding Questions I couldn't find an answer to (yet)

- (CSS) Best way to center my container div?
- (CSS) Resizing makes Total/PerPerson Sum disappear instead of shifting?
- (CSS) Overlay image on top of input ?

## Where do I need feedback?

- Readibility

  - -> I never coded for someone else to read my code -> is everything understandable?
  - any tips to further increase readibility/write clean code ?

- Efficiency

  - how efficient is my code?
  - is there anything obvious that could be changed in order to optimize performance?
    - e.g. not sure whether for loops + eventListeners is a really good combo?
